# CineExplorer
CineExplorer is a responsive web app that fetches real-time movie data from **TMDB API**.
Users can browse popular, top-rated, upcoming or now-playing movies, search for specific titles, view detailed information (including cast, trailers, similar recommendations), and add movies to watchlist or favourite list. Prefences like like dark mode or list are persisted locally using the browser storage.
The app emphasizes a clean, user-friendly interface with modern features like pagination for endless scrolling through results and modal for immersive movie details.
